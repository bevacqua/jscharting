<h2>Introduction</h2>


Chart types are constructed using several settings. Among them, the most significant are:
<ul>
    <li>Chart Type</li>
    <li>Series Type</li>
    <li>Axis Scale</li>
</ul>

The most fundamental property, <a href="Types.chart.type">chart.type</a>, determines the generic layout of series.
It can be set with these predefined settings: <a href="Enums.chartType">chartType enum</a>.
Axis scales further contribute to how elements are laid out, i.e. (Stacked).
The series type determines how the series are visualized (line, bar, etc.).
These properties work in concert to provide flexibility in setting up specific chart types.

<h2>Chart Type Settings</h2>
JSC has a very powerful and flexible chart type setting mechanism. It allows expressing data in
different arrangements of chart types in a simplified way. The functionality of chart type settings
is based on Enum chaining and it's recommended to read this short intro to get the basic idea.

<h3>Definitions</h3>

        <ul class="simpleKvpList">
            <li><em>Chart</em><section>A visualization of multiple data series.  The data a chart can show is also known as a series collection.</section></li>
            <li><em>Series</em><section>A collection of data points.</section></li>
            <li><em>Chart Type</em><section>Specifies how multiple series are arranged together to form a visual.</section></li>
            <li><em>Series Type</em><section>Specifies  how  a set of data points is visualized on a chart.</section></li>
        </ul>
<!--Chart - A visualization of multiple data series.  The data a chart can show is also known as a series collection.
Series - A collection of data points.

Chart Type - Specifies how multiple series are arranged together to form a visual.
Series Type - Specifies  how  a set of data points is visualized on a chart.-->


<h2>Chart Type</h2>

<p>
The chart types enum provides the root options for this setting.
However, since default values don't have to be specified, the series type can be set at this level as well. For instance:
</p>
<span class="codeText">
{
type:'lineStep'
}
</span>

Which is the equivalent of:
<span class="codeText">
{
type:'VerticalLineStep'
}
</span>

This option defines a chart type, a series type, and the line series type specific option step.


<h2>Series Types</h2>

The most important contributor to chart types is the <a href="Types.series.type">series.type</a> property.
It can be set with these predefined settings: <a href="Enums.seriesType">seriesType enum</a>.

Each series can have a different series type setting.
<span class="codeText">{
series:[{
type:'lineStep'
}]
} </span>


A series type can also be applied to all series in the chart by setting it for the defaultSeries like so:
<span class="codeText">{
defaultSeries:{
type:'lineStep'
}
} </span>

<h2>Chart Type  v.s. Default Series Type</h2>

        <p>
A series type property can also be set with a chart type value. This implies that the series should be treated as a chart or series collection itself. For example, the chart type of a vertical line chart with a number of series is 'Vertical'. But if one of those series should be a pie, it can be accomplished by setting 'pie' for that series' type property.  Since pie is a chart type, this series is removed from the vertical X Y axis chart area, and shown as its own pie chart.
</p><p>
If 'pie' was set for the chart type property, all the series would be combined into a single pie.
</p>
<span class="codeText">{
type:'pie'
} </span>


If pie is applied to default series type, this indicates that each series becomes its own pie producing a number of pies.
<span class="codeText">{
defaultSeries:{
type:'pie'
}
} </span>
<p>
    The first setting implies that this chart or series collection is a pie and results single pie. The second sitting implies
    that each series is a pie and results in a pie for each series.
</p>
<p>
Along with pie, this behavior allows specifying a single radar or multiple radars in a single chart.
</p>

        <h3>More complex scenarios</h3>
        <h4>Single Pie</h4>
<p>Consider a chart with 4 series. The following code creates a chart with a single pie:</p>
<span class="codeText">{
type:'pie', //The main chart type is a pie
} </span>

<h4>Multiple Pies</h4>
<p>Consider a chart with 4 series. The following code creates a chart with four pies:</p>
<span class="codeText">{
defaultSeriesType:'pie', //The main chart type for each series a pie
} </span>

<h4>Mixed Pies</h4>
<p>Consider a chart with 4 series. The goal is to achieve a complex result where the first 3 series are represented by slices on
    a single pie. And the fourth series is a pie with slices for each point. This can be achieved with the following setting:</p>
<span class="codeText">{
type:'pie', //The main chart type is a pie
    series:[
    {},
    {},
    {},
    {type:'pie'//Chart type for the fourth series.
    }
    ]

} </span>


<h4>Single Radar</h4>
<p>Radars are similar but different than pies because aside from being a chart type, they also require a series types.
    Consider a single radar chart with 4 line series. This can be set with:
</p>

<span class="codeText">{
type:'radarLine'
} </span>

<h4>Single Radar with Differing Series Types</h4>
<p>
    Consider a single radar chart with 4 different series types. This can be set with:
</p>

<span class="codeText">{
type:'radar' , //The main chart type is radar
    series:[
    {type:'line' },
    {type:'column' },
    {type:'marker' },
    {type:'lineSpline' },
    ]
} </span>

<h4>Multiple Radars</h4>
<p>
    Consider a chart with four line series radars. This can be set with:
</p>
<span class="codeText">{
defaultSeriesType:'radarLine'
} </span>

<h4>Multiple Radars with Differing Series Types</h4>
<p>
    Consider a chart with four differing series type radars. This can be set with:
</p>
<span class="codeText">{
defaultSeriesType:'radar',
     series:[
    {type:'line' },
    {type:'column' },
    {type:'marker' },
    {type:'lineSpline' },
    ]
} </span>

<p></p>
<p></p>

<h3>Pie/Donut Types</h3>
        Pie series types behave slightly different than other series types like bars or lines. Their placement is
not affected by the <a href="Types.chart.type">chart.type</a> setting.
Instead, they float on top of the chart area, and can be positioned through the <a href="Types.series.position">series.position</a> property.
-->

<h3>Marker Types</h3>

Series types line, area, marker, and other types use the <a href="Types.pointMarker.type">point.marker.type</a> setting.
It can be set with these predefined settings: <a href="Enums.markerTypes">markerTypes enum</a>.
        Marker types also affect the chart type to some degree as they control the shape of the point visuals.


<h2>Axis Scales</h2>

Further customization is achieved by specifying the <a href="Types.axis.scale">yAxis.scale</a> property.
It can be set with these predefined settings: <a href="Enums.scale">scale enum</a>.
Besides controlling the quantitative scale type,
scales also dictate how series are arranged. For example an axis scale can specify that columns are stacked, or fullStacked.
