                <li><strong>Sample Explorer</strong> - This tool provides a quick way to search and 
				browse samples matching your criteria.&nbsp; You can also 
				navigate the sample browser broken down by specific tasks.
                                                     Please see the <a href="Tutorials.SampleExplorer">SampleExplorer</a> for more information.
                    By default, samples that are supported in the editor will 
				open in that view, otherwise, the sample file will be directly 
				opened. All samples are available in the /Samples folder as HTML files 
				you can view or edit directly as you wish.</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation</strong> - The JSCharting
				documentation provides a collection of tutorials along with a 
				complete API reference. The API reference is split into 2 sections: JSON Config and JS Objects.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <a href="index.htm#node=API.Json" class="refLink">JSON Config</a> section defines
						JSON configuration objects used to specify settings for the chart, as well
                            as pre-defined string settings under the <a href="Enums" class="refLink">Enums node</a>. Please note that the
                            <a href="Types.chart" class="refLink">Chart</a> node under JSON Config is type similar to those listed under the <a href="Types" class="refLink">Types node</a>, and is simply a link to provide quicker access
						to this most commonly used configuration. </li>
                        <li>The <a href="iObject" class="refLink">JS Objects</a> section defines the direct API
						for the JSCharting library. The <a href="iObject.JSC" class="refLink">JSC object</a> can be used to create a chart,
						while the remaining objects are returned by methods
                            and are not instantiated directly. The <a href="iObject.JSC.Chart()" class="refLink">JSC.Chart() method</a> constructs a <a href="iObject.chart" class="refLink">chart JS Object</a> and is the primary way to generate a chart.
                            It takes a <a href="Types.chart" class="refLink">Chart JSON</a>
                            configuration to define the chart's settings. </li>

JSON Objects also contain a Chart node. This is a type like those listed under Types, but was promoted to allow easier access to it.

                           It provides a method that constructs a chart as well as some utility methods.
                           All other types listed there are not constructed manually but returned by the chart object itself. </p>

<h2>Learning JSCharting</h2>
             <p>      There are two main ways to learn how to develop charts using JSCharting. One is to read the relevant tutorials and API documentation to get a good understanding of
			the products functionality and capabilities. The other way is to find samples that demonstrate features specific to your requirements and use similar code. A mix of these approaches is ideal, but
            finding related samples to your needs will get you up and running 
			faster. The JSC SampleExplorer is designed to make finding samples much more efficient.
            Please see the <a href="Tutorials.SampleExplorer">SampleExplorer</a> for more information.






			Once you have found a sample, you can quickly prototype and 
			customize the settings using the JSCharting Editor.</p>
