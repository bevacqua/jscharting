		<p>The navigator is a chart mode that enables interactivity and exploration of stock data in real-time.
		More advanced time scale zooming and navigation are the hallmarks of 
		this feature. It is similar to charts often seen on popular finance 
		websites.</p>
		<p>The navigator mode can be set through the chart type property as follows:</p>
		<span class="codeText">{
            type:'navigator'
            }</span>

	<span class="docsTip">The Silverlight version of navigator is one of
		the most advanced versions of such a finance chart in existence. This
		can be enabled when chartJson.renderMode is set to &#39;Silverlight&#39; in 
		conjunction with the above setting. The advancements of this component 
		are mainly in the UI and its ability to smoothly move data around as you 
		scroll or resize.</span>

		<h2>Finance Series Types</h2>
		All standard series types are supported, with the addition of some 
		finance specific types including:
		<ul>
			<li>Candlestick</li>
			<li>OHLC</li>
		</ul>
				Regular
		bar and line types are supported with the navigator, however, with candlestick or ohlc, points don&#39;t have the usual y values. They have
		4 new values: open, high, low, and close.
		<h2>Populating Data</h2>
		When not using the finance specific series types, the general
		<a href="Tutorials.populateData">data population</a> applies. With
		finance types, all data points are defined as arrays of values in the 
		following format:
		<span class="docsSyntax">[xDateTime, open, high, low, close]</span>
		<h2>UI Interface Options</h2>
		Any part of the interface shown in figure 1 can be disabled.
