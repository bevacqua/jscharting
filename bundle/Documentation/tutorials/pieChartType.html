<h2>Z Values</h2>
        <p></p>
In addition to the general pie type, a secondary value can be encoded into <a href="Types.point.z">point z properties</a>. If point z values are defined, it will
vary the pie slice radius. Both positive and negative z values can be used which create different visual effects.
</p>
        <p>
The z values are plotted along a z axis which is similar to a polar y axis. The z axis is 0 based and behaves similar to a normal column chart, except the columns are slices.
</p>
        <p>
These pie charts demonstrate the different behaviors of using positive, negative, and both positive and negative z values.</p>

<h3>Z Value Formatting</h3>

<p>
    The x and y axis <a href="Types.axis.formatString">formatString</a>  settings provide default formatting for those values in any point
    related text such as labels and tooltips.



</p>
<p>While the z axis is not currently a property of chart, the formatting properties of the z axis can be set at the chart level as shown below.</p>
<p>This image shows a chart with z values representing life expectancy.</p>

    <h2>Angles & Arcs</h2>
Starting angles can be used with pie charts.
<span class="codeText">
{
defaultSeriesAngle:45
}
</span>
<span class="docsReference">
    Samples.pieAngled
</span>
<p>
Starting and ending angles can be used together to create pie arcs as with the following example.</p>
<span class="tutorialImage">
<img src="tutorials/images/pieArcLarge.png"/>
<em>Figure 3.</em>
</span>

<span class="codeText">
{
 defaultSeriesAngle:{
            start:80,
            end:100
}
</span>
<span class="docsReference">
    Samples.donutArc
</span>
        <p>

The <a href="Types.angleArc">angleArc</a> object also provides properties for orientation and sweep. Orientation is the center angle between start and end angles.</p>
        <p>The following has the same effect as the above start and end angle settings, however,
            it is given in orientation and sweep which makes it easier to think about.</p>
<span class="codeText">
{
 defaultSeriesAngle:{
           orientation:90,
            sweep:20
}
</span>
<p>
Sweep can be given in numeric degrees or as a percentage string such as <span class="example">&#39;50%&#39;</span> which is equivalent to 180 degrees.
If a string is provided, tokens can also be used. For example, consider a series of pie data split into two series.
One series can be set with an orientation of <span class="example">-90</span> degrees (facing left) and the other with <span class="example">90</span> degrees (facing right).
The sweep can be set with <span class="example">&#39;%percentOfTotal%&#39;</span>. This creates the effect of a single pie separated into two.
</p>
<p>
This case can be especially useful when there are many smaller points on a pie chart. They can be put into a different pie
arc which automatically scales up in size.</p>

        <h2>Layout And Scaling</h2>
<h3>Scaling</h3>
        <p>Depending on pie arc angles, some pie segments are overall smaller in size than they would be as a full 360 degree pie.
            JSC scales these up to match the width or height of all other pies as seen in figure 4.</p>
<h3>Default Layout</h3>
<p>Pie layout uses an algorithm that determines the most efficient number of columns and rows to maximize pie sizes.</p>

<p>As pies may have varying point labels lengths, this can interfere with the automatic layout system.</p>
        <h3>Tweaking pie layout.</h3>
        <p>The series shape property which refers to the <a href="Types.series.shape">series.shape config</a> settings offer a number of
            settings to allow manual layout adjustments.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following pie chart</p>
<span class="tutorialImage">
<img src="tutorials/images/pieMisaligned.png"/>
<em>Figure 5.</em>
</span>

        <p> Applying the following settings adjusts the chart to show correctly. These values are given as 'x,y' in pixels.</p>
<span class="codeText">
{
  series:[{
      /*...*/
        shapeOffset:'70,20'
    },{
         /*...*/
        shapeOffset:'-70,20'
    }]
}

<h3>Padding Pies</h3>
<p>In cases where pies or other similar series are too crowded, a general padding value can be applied for the entire chart.</p>

<span class="codeText">
{
defaultSeries:{
        shapePadding:.2
    }
}
