<h2>Layout / Position</h2>
		The legend can be positioned anywhere around the chart area by setting 
		the  <a href="Types.legend.position">legend.position</a> property. Possible setting include top, left, right,
		topLeft, and so on.
		<span class="docsReference">Enums.orientation: A complete list of orientation settings.</span>
<h3>Orientation</h3>
		<span class="codeText">json.legendPosition = &#39;topLeft&#39;;</span>

		This positioning can also be used in conjunction with the offset 
		property to make small adjustments:

		<span class="codeText">json.legendOffset = &#39;5,5&#39;;
		</span>
		A margin property is available to specify the distance between the 
		chartArea and legend:

		<span class="codeText">json.legendMargin = 5;<br />
		</span>
    <h3>Absolute Positioning</h3>
		The legend can use absolute positioning by passing the position property an x,y coordinate 
		relative to the top left of the chart image:

		<span class="codeText">json.legendPosition = &#39;20,10&#39;;</span>
    <h3>Relative Positioning</h3>
		To position the legend relative to the top left corner of the chartArea, 
		use:

		<span class="codeText">json.legendPosition = &#39;CA:20,10&#39;;</span>
    <h3>Legend Entry Orientation</h3>
		When using a position name such as &#39;topLeft&#39; the legend entries are 
		automatically laid out either vertically or horizontally depending on 
		the position. However, with absolute or relative positioning, this 
		setting should be specified with the legend.layout property:

		<span class="codeText">json.legendLayout = &#39;horizontal&#39;;<br />
		</span>
		A static width can be specified for the legend:

		<span class="codeText">json.legendWidth = 20;</span>

		<h2>Styling</h2>

		Styling the legendbox is similar to styling the title and annotations. 
		Properties such as <a href="Types.legend.fill">fill</a>,
    <a href="Types.legend.outline">outline</a>,
    <a href="Types.legend.radius">radius</a>,
    <a href="Types.legend.shadow">shadow</a> are all available.

        </span>
		<h2>Entries</h2>
		Legend entries represent data on the chart. Series have individual 
		legendEntry properties but the legend object has a defaultLegendEntry 
		property that specifies the defaults for all entries and is recommended 
		unless series specific settings are necessary.

		<span class="docsSample">SeriesLegendEntry:
		Specifies series specific legend entry properties.</span>

		<h2>Labels</h2>
		Legend entry labels support series tokens providing the ability
		to describe the data in a robust way without using label callback 
		functions or series specific legend entry settings.

		<span class="codeText">json.legendDefaultEntryText = &#39;%name (%sum)&#39;;</span>

		<span class="docsSample">LegendTokens</span>

		<h2>Layout</h2>
		As mentioned previously, legend entries can be laid out either 
		vertically or horizontally. A width can be specified for each entry as 
		well as entry <a href="Types.legendEntry.padding">padding</a> and
    <a href="Types.legendEntry.iconWidth">iconWidth</a>. This can be used to achieve a
		multi-column grid layout of entries. When entries lay out horizontally but legend 
		width is set and not sufficient for all entries, they wrap to the next 
		line. By setting a static width for each entry, a width for the legend 
		and using horizontal layout, a grid layout can be achieved as 
		demonstrated in the following sample:

		<span class="docsSample">LegendBoxGrid</span>
    <span class="docsTasks">
            Tasks.Legend.Layout
        </span>
		<h2>Sorting</h2>
		Legend entries are listed in the order their series are added to the chart. 
		However, setting legend.reverse reverses the order of the entries. A 
		custom sort order can also be implemented by setting the  <a href="Types.legendEntry.sortOrder">sortOrder</a>
		property of individual series legend entries.

		<span class="docsSample">LegendEntryOrder</span>

		<h2>Events &amp; Interactivity</h2>
		By default, legend entries are interactive and provide the ability to 
		hide/show individual series when clicked. This behavior can also be disabled.
		<span class="docsSample">LegendEvents:
		Hooks into the legend entry click and confirms whether the default 
		show/hide series behavior should be executed.</span>

		<h2>States</h2>
		Legend entries are clickable and therefore visual states are provided to 
		indicate when mouse hovers or the entry is disabled. The two entry 
		states are named &#39;hover&#39; and &#39;hidden&#39;.

		<span class="docsSample">LegendStyling:
		Demonstrates styling of legend entry states.</span>

		Legend entries support cascading states which means that if a 
		setting is applied to the normal state, it will affect subsequent states 
		like hover and hidden. Internally this cascading processes higher level 
		setting and modifies it to reflect the new state more accurately unless 
		otherwise specified. This may help reduce the amount of code necessary 
		to achieve an obviously desired effect. For example, setting a font 
		propagates that font to subsequent states.
