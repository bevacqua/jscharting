<h2>State Behaviors</h2>
		A number of objects have state settings that define their appearance  when
		in a particular state such as a button&#39;s hover appearance.
		<h2>Cascading States
		</h2>States of an object are interpreted as having an order in which
		they occur, for example, a button has states such as Normal, Hover, Clicked and they occur in that
		order. JSC implements functionality that considers this order and helps 
		cascade the settings from one state to the next. For example, if a font 
		is specified for the normal state, it will propagate to subsequent 
		states automatically and not require the user to specify the same setting
		for each state. If a setting is specified for the hover state, it will 
		propagate to the clicked state, but not back to the normal state.<br />
		<br />
		Cascading state settings don&#39;t just propagate through states, settings of the previous state are used as a starting point, and then
        they are modified so that the visual difference between states is still obvious.
		For example, setting a button&#39;s fill color to orange will propagate that 
		color to the hover state but will darken it slightly to indicate the
		button is in a different state.
		<span class="docsNote">This type of behavior also exists in other 
		scenarios such as when setting a button&#39;s fill property, a similar color will 
		automatically propagate to the button&#39;s outline color  
		unless otherwise specified.</span>
		This functionality is highly tuned to give the best visual results with 
		the least amount of settings and let the developer focus on other core 
		requirements. <br />
		<br />
		The following table lists objects that implement states and the states
		available for each.

		<span class="docsNote">These objects all include a Normal state which is 
		implied but not specified below. The API for these normal settings are 
		at the objects root like obj.color whereas setting properties for states 
		listed below require setting similar to obj.states.hover.color.</span>

		<h2>Data Object States</h2>
		<span class="docsNote">Data point&#39;s &#39;Select&#39; state requires that its 
		parent series pointSelection property is set to true.
		</span>
		Data objects including series, point, and pointMarker have the most 
		complex sequence and architecture of state property propagation because 
		points include point markers. However, this complexity is there working 
		behind the scenes and reduces the need to think about all the states and 
		settings. The intention of this functionality is to simply work as 
		expected despite having a complicated API architecture. For example, 
		with a marker series type, the setting point.hover.outline.color setting 
		can also be set through point.marker.states.hover.outline.color or 
		point.states.marker.outline.color. Each of these should work and the 
		approach is up to the developer, however, using setting 
		point.hover.outline.color is ideal because it will affect the data 
		point&#39;s outline whether it&#39;s a marker, bar, or any other type that uses 
		an outline. This API is there for when bars and other series types 
		support markers.<br />
