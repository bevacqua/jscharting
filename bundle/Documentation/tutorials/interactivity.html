				The chart is equipped with interactive features that allow users to modify the data display in real-time by clicking the legend entry to hide/show series.
        When series.pointSelection is set to true, users can select one or more data points of that series. The chart can
then return the info on the selected points programmatically.

&nbsp;
<h3>Visual States</h3>
Interactive elements such as points, labels, buttons, and legend entries include state properties that control the visual appearance of those
objects in certain states. For example when a mouse hovers a data point, its color may change.

<h2>Events</h2>
Events provide a way to execute code when specific interactions occur with the chart, or during certain stages of the chart rendering process. The
click event is used as an example below to demonstrate the API ease of use. 
&nbsp;
<h3>Intro with Click Event as example</h3>
JSCharting has some convenient API features built in to improve working with events. The traditional way to setup say a point click event looks like:
&nbsp;
<span class="codeText">
Points:[
{
/*...*/
events:{
click:  function(e){ 
// event code
alert(this.name);
}
},
statesHover:{
cursor:&#39;poiner&#39;
},{/*...*/}
]</span>

However, a string can be used in place of a function to achieve the same result. Note that with strings, tokens such as <span class="example">&#39;%name&#39;</span> can be used instead of
object properties like  <span class="example">&#39;this.name&#39;</span>. The advantage to using strings is that is makes it much faster to implement simple cases and reduces the amount of code
        necessary to achieve similar goals and will suffice for most scenarios while using functions is still available if necessary.

<span class="codeText">
Points:[
{
/*...*/
events:{
click: &#39;Javascript:alert(&quot;%name&quot;);&#39;
},
statesHoverCursor:&#39;poiner&#39;
},
{/*...*/}
]</span>

Another simplification of this feature is to use the point URL property. This wraps the click event and cursor management automatically. The final and 
easiest approach can be:

<span class="codeText">Points:[
{
/*...*/
url: &#39;alert(&quot;%name&quot;);&#39;
},
{/*...*/}
]</span>
