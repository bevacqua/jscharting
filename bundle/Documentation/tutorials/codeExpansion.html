		JSON Configuration used by the chart follows an object oriented 
		API to define settings that span a hierarchy of objects. For
		example an axis tick label can be set by using the following json:
		<span class="codeText">{<br />
		yAxis:{<br />
		defaultTick:{<br />
		label:{<br />
		text:&#39;%value&#39;<br />
		}<br />
		}<br />
		}<br />
		}</span>
		This setting is defined deep within the hierarchy and despite being a 
		bit complex, is a standard 
		approach in such a scenario. JSCharting however provides a mechanism 
		that makes applying such settings much easier. This is achieved by using 
		a single property setting that capitalizes and concatenates all
		subsequent properties into one name and used at the root level like so:
		<span class="codeText">{<br />
		yAxisDefaultTickLabelText:&#39;%value&#39;<br />
		}</span>
		This setting will be evaluated by the chart into the fully expanded code 
		shown above.
		<span class="docsCaution">Notice how 
		subsequent property names like 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">d</span>efaultTick becomes
		capitalized:
		yAxis<span style="text-decoration: underline">D</span>efaultTick
		when used in this context.</span>
		JSCharting utilizes an API definition file that contains all the 
		properties and related metadata to make this processing work for all 
		available properties, perform well and 
		without error. Minor spelling mistakes in property names can make 
		libraries miss the property and cost time tracking down the issue. This 
		processing allows the chart to validate the specified json 
		and property settings to ensure all intended settings are valid. <br />
		<br />
		Due to this approach, it is possible to define the same property 
		multiple times. For example the following code specifies the same 
		setting twice:
		<span class="codeText">{<br />
		label:{text:&#39;textA&#39;},<br />
		labelText:&#39;textB&#39;<br />
		}</span>
		In this instance, the more expanded property takes precedence and 
		overwrites the aliased version. Running this json through the chart will 
		result in the following code:
		<span class="codeText">{<br />
		label:{text:&#39;textA&#39;}<br />
		}</span>
		When labelText is expanded into label.text, and this value is already 
		defined, it will be ignored.
		<span class="docsNote">When defining json configuration to be used as a 
		chart template. The chart expands both the chart configuration and 
		template before the settings are merged. Therefore, this precedence does 
		not influence use of templates.</span>
		<span class="docsCaution">Some properties such as xAxis and yAxis can be 
		set with an axis object, or with an array of axis objects. If an array 
		of axes is used and an aliased axis property is set, it may cause 
		problems as it will not be expanded into one of the axis objects in the 
		array but as a property of the array. </span>
