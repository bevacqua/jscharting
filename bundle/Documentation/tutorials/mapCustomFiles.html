<h4>Using custom map files directly.</h4>
<p>Map files can be used to populate series points like so</p>
<span class="codeText">{
	series:[{
		map:'mapData/usCapitals.json.txt'
	}]
}</span>
<span class="docsCaution">
Please note that in samples we use usCapitals.json.txt text file extension as a workaround for json mime types not being included by default with many server setups. In order to use this file, use the .txt extension or rename it.
</span>

<h4>Custom map file reference.</h4>

<p>Custom map files can be used in their entirety, or just specific map features defined in those files can be used on a chart.</p>

<p>In order to use only some map features from a custom map file, the map file must be made available to the chart through the <a href="Types.chart.mapping">mapping.referenceLayers</a> property.

</p>
<span class="codeText">{
	mapping:{
		referenceLayers:'mapData/usCapitals.json.txt'
	}
}</span>

<p>Now, series and points can refer to map features defined in this reference layer using mapCodes or propertyFilters.
</p>
<span class="docsTip">
Both geoJSON and topoJSON file formats are supported. They can be specified using a relative path. When a custom map file is specified for a series, a point is generated for each feature in that map file.
</span>

<h3>Reference layer mapCodes</h3>

<h4>Using in a series</h4>
<p>When a map file path is specified in a referenceLayer, this file can be subsequently be referred to by its filename without extension. In this example it is "usCapitals".
</p>
<p>The following code creates a series with points for each map feature in the usCapitals.json file.
</p>
<span class="codeText">{
	series:[{
		map:'usCapitals'
	}]
}</span>
<p>The above example has the same effect as the first snippet on this page.</p>

<h4>By map feature IDs</h4>

<p>The following code creates a point based on a map feature defined in the usCapitals file that has the ID of 'springfield'. </p>
<span class="codeText">{
	series:[{
		//indicates a map feature in the usCapitals map with an id of 'springfield'
		points:[{map:'usCapitals.springfield'}]
	}]
}</span>

<span class="docsCaution">
If a filename contains multiple periods, the part before the first period becomes the id.
</span>

<h3>Reference layer propertyFilters</h3>
<h4>Series from propertyFilters</h4>
<p>A series can also be created from all map features with a property matching a specific value.</p>
<span class="codeText">{
	series:[{
		map:'usCapitals.region:west'
	}]
}</span>
<p>In this example, points are created for each map feature in the usCapitals file where the region property matches 'west'.</p>
<p>Similarly, points for specific map features can be defined to modify those points or to add additional points to a series.

</p>
<span class="codeText">{
	series:[{
		map:'usCapitals.region:west',
		points:[{
			map:'usCapitals.springfield',
			color:'red'
		}]
	}]
}</span>
